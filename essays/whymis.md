With the advancement and integration of technology in nearly all aspects of our modern world, the importance that technology plays in business is becoming more and more everyday. Originally, I had declared myself strictly as an accounting major; however, after reading countless articles about the importance of information systems and data analytics, I decided that it would be in my best interest to combine my accounting degree with something more technical. At first, I was confused. I was unsure if I should focus on something more coding intensive such as computer science, or maybe something focused on structures, such as security systems. Thankfully I eventually found MIS, or management information systems, and realized that this major was the perfect solution to my dilemma. Given that this is my first semester in this new field, I am extremely nervous but also excited for what this journey holds for me.
